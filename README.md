<b> Research question </b>
<br>  

From this research we are going to analyze the performance of field crops during Maha seasons from 2001 to 2012. The data set which is used was published by Open Data Initiative of Government of Sri Lanka. We are able to analyze the data, year wise, seasonal crops and vegetables wise, cultivated amount and harvested amount wise. 

Even though farmers cultivated seasonal crops and vegetables, some alternatives products are imported to Sri Lanka. Because of that, this harvest which is cultivated within Sri Lanka is wasted. So we are going to discuss how can we use results in useful manner within Sri Lankan agricultural sector.
